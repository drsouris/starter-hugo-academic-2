I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/polwiss/forschung/systeme/polsystem/Team/Antonios-Souris.html">Freie Universität Berlin</a> and <a href="https://www.laws-of-social-cohesion.de/Researchers/Junior-Researchers/Souris/index.html">Berlin University Alliance</a>. My primary research interests are in federalism, parliaments, and European politics. In my dissertation, I have studied sub-national coordination and conflicts in EU affairs based on an original <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IRXJEM">dataset</a>, comprising 6.200 roll call votes in the German Bundesrat. The dissertation received the <a href="https://foederalismus.at/foederalismuspreis/preistraeger_2021.php">Federalism & Regional Studies Award 2021</a> by the Institute for Federalism (Austria). Currently, I am working on political communication strategies in federal systems during the Covid-19-crisis. I am always happy to have a chat about my work - you find me (too) often on Twitter.
